# sendesp32datatoreactjsandthensubmitformandstoreittodatabase
i simply want that i will send the data through the http post method and react js will store the data in the input form of the field and when i click on the submit button then the data will be stored into the database

# all the code is working fine. my system ip is 192.168.1.29. if you want to implement this just need to change the system ip in the url http post. we will change in the arduino first. and use the same url in react also and in flask also.

# firstly the data is sent from the esp32 to flask. flask will receive the data from the esp32 using one api and make one more api to send the data to the react js. and react js will receive the data. and this code works fine
